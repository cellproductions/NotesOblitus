TODO:
- finish the Help menu item
- add syntax saving/loading/editing for the preview window (colours, fonts, background/foreground/etc colours) (should probs be per project as well)
- add some way to specify descriptions for tags
- add method of minimizing the number of notes in the different modes by gathering notes with multiple tags into single notes
- add priority options for tags (they can be coloured in the main view as well)
- links to sites or whatever (sensitive stuff) should be md5 hashed
- create a status bar or something that tells the user when they have saved, etc.

- mention version details in the help
- add changelog + license to the Help section
- update major/minor version numbers in GlobalVars

BUGS:
- preview doesnt catch all syntax cases (numbers starting with 0x, or some cases involving notes, not to mention some from other languages. should simplify it)
- sometimes scanning a directory from File->Scan Directory doesnt add a path to the recent search paths list (either the File->recent searches or the Project.RecentSearches)
- scanning a directory by pressing a recent search path does not quite update the current view

TEST:
- make sure the patcher also runs in elevated mode when started from the main app in elevated mode
- make sure the proxy settings work
