TODO:
- finish the Help menu item
- add syntax saving/loading/editing for the preview window (colours, fonts, background/foreground/etc colours)
- add some way to specify descriptions for tags
- add method of minimizing the number of notes in the different modes by gathering notes with multiple tags into single notes
- add rightclick options to tick/untick all child nodes
- add rightclick options to notes in the views to delete/preview/edit
- add priority options for tags (they can be coloured in the main view as well)
- links to sites or whatever (sensitive stuff) should be md5 hashed

- mention version details in the help
- add changelog to the Help section
- add the license to the About section (could also place it in the help section as well)
- update version number (in GlobalVars, until the auto updater is finished)

BUGS:
- preview doesnt catch all syntax cases (numbers starting with 0x, or some cases involving notes)

TEST:
